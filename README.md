# Hiya Guard - Real-Time Voice Call Screening Agent

## About the Product

Hiya Guard AI is a real-time voice AI call screening agent that intelligently handles incoming calls, detects spam/scam attempts, and manages legitimate calls by scheduling a callback via Google calendar integration. 

I built this solution for Hiya to demonstrate my advanced voice AI capabilities in setting up sub-2.5 second response times and natural conversation flows. This shows how my skill set aligns with the AI Engineer role at Hiya.

**Disclosure**: I am super interested in the role at Hiya and find Hiya's products extremely useful in the current market. So I wanted to put this section there to showcase how my proposed product could add value to the existing products at Hiya. Hence, I named it Hiya Guard!

### Key Features
- **Real-time streaming** - <2.5s response time with streaming STT (Speech to Text), LLM, and TTS (Text to Speech)
- **Smart spam detection** - GPT-4o powered intent classification with 90%+ accuracy
- **Natural conversation** - Professional voice responses by integrating external TTS API from ElevenLabs
- **Calendar Tool Calling** - Agent smartly calls the calendar tool to find the available time slots and schedules a callback
- **Call summaries** - Structured transcript analysis and outcome reporting so that the user gets the gist of the call before the callback

  - Integrated ElevenLabs TTS with async audio generation
  - Added WebRTC VAD for intelligent audio chunking
  - Optimized audio pipeline with proper error handling

#### 4. **Ensuring Security and Data Protection**
- **Challenge**: Protecting the system against VoIP vulnerabilities, such as eavesdropping and network attacks, while maintaining user trust and data integrity
- **Security Considerations**:
  - API key protection and secure storage
  - OAuth 2.0 implementation for Google Calendar
  - No persistent storage of sensitive call content
  - Secure credential management with environment variables
- **Implementation**:
  - Used `.env` files for API keys with proper `.gitignore` protection
  - Implemented secure OAuth flow for calendar access
  - Added input sanitization and error handling
  - No local storage of call transcripts or audio data

#### Additional Technical Challenges Overcome:
- **Audio Feedback Prevention**: Implemented proper audio routing and recommended headphone usage
- **API Rate Limiting**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff for API failures
- **Memory Management**: Optimized audio buffer handling to prevent memory leaks
- **Concurrent Processing**: Built async architecture to handle multiple services simultaneously
